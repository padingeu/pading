Keeping in touch with friends is not always easy, especially when each of you are going about your daily life or beginning new projects. Of course, we do not claim to have the key to maintaining relationships but we have a few tips we can share from our experience.',

        'Human beings are made to interact physically so when you find the opportunity to meet each other, do it! Book flights and trains, travel and enjoy your reunion. Long-distance relationships have a huge advantage as moments shared together through travel are generally intense, true and unique. Another advantage is that these friendships will give you motivation to help discover the world. We would suggest visiting your friends in their hometowns. What is better than traveling somewhere and being able to see where your friend grew up in, where he studies or works and meet his/her friends and family. Plus, you will have the benefits of a local guide to help soak up your surroundings.',

It is often the perfect place to feel at home away from home, remember nice memories and continue to write together the history of the place. But we also highly recommend discovering new places together. This is the reason why we have created Pading, the only travel app organizer that allows you to fly from multiple origins to a common destination at the lowest fare. Tell us where you and your friends come frome, fill in the journey dates and the algorithm will do the job for you. In just a few clicks, you can book your trip and look forward to meeting each other.',

        'The travel industry brings many good things. It allows us to discover new people and cultures and thus brings the openness we all need in this world. When it is affordable, it allows many people to get out of their daily routine and take a deep breath. For host countries and their inhabitants, tourism is a source of economic and social development and can lift many people out of poverty. Finally, and this is the first question we want to answer with Pading, travel allows distant friends, couples and families to meet each other because not everyone decides where to live or where their loved ones should live. Here, Pading proposes to reduce the distance and make it possible for people to get together much more often.',

        'Of course, tourism is not only a victim of global warming but also the contributor to it. Tourism alone is responsible for 8% of the world\'s carbon emissions. And this footprint is only growing. If we want to protect people (us), save the wonderful ecosystems and diversity on Earth, we have to change our behaviour. It is up to us. *And when we talk about the impact of travel on global warming, we are talking about something that has a huge weight on our total annual CO2 emissions.',

        'First of all, we can choose the appropriate means of transport. A journey from Madrid to London for one passenger emits by train: 3kg CO2, by plane 240kg CO2 and by car 400kg CO2. However, you do not always have a choice because of the travel time, the price or simply the existing offer. In any case, it is better to avoid stopovers when flying.',

We also strongly recommend to offset carbon footprint directly on Pading website. It is a citizen act and it sounds good to pay the right price: the price of the ticket plus the price of offsetting this environmental impact. By offsetting your CO2 emissions, you are making a donation to reforestation projects.',

The list is not exhaustive but we can start by using as little plastic as possible, being careful with your waste, using digital tickets instead of printed ones, taking public transport, walking or biking once at your destination and making a point of giving your money to local and responsible shops, cafes and restaurants rather than to global brands.',
